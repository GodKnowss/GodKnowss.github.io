This work was inspired by [Dr Peyam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8LwWEGNyyM). The original insights from the video provided the foundation for the algebraic perspective presented here, 
which I have extended and formalized to develop a deeper understanding of convolution through polynomial multiplication and system interaction principles.

Here is a note on convolution intuition.
