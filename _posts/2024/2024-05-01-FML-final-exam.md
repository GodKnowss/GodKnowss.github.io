Here are the [study notes 1](/files/UF_materials/Courses/EEE4773/EEE4773_Midterm.pdf), [study notes 2](/files/UF_materials/Courses/EEE4773/EEE_4773_Final.pdf) 
and our [final report](/files/UF_materials/Courses/EEE4773/EEE4773_Final_Report.pdf) that my friend, [Justin Beauchesne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-beauchesne/), 
and I put together while preparing for the Fundamentals of Machine Learning final exam. <br>
We spent countless hours organizing the key concepts, and I thought they might be useful for other students tackling this subject!
