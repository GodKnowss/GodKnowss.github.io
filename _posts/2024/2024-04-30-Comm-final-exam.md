Here are the comprehensive [study notes](/files/UF_materials/Courses/EEL4514C/Comm_Notes_Sheet.pdf) that my friend, [Stanley Zheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhengstanley/), and I put together while preparing for 
[Dr. John Shea's Communication Systems](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/syllabi/Spring%202024/EEL4514C_Comm_Sys_Comp_Shea_Spring_2024.pdf) final exam. <br>
We spent countless hours organizing the key concepts, and I thought they might be useful for other students tackling this subject!
