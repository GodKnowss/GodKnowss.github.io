Graduating with the highest honors can strengthen your graduate school applications and demonstrate your research capabilities, but the process can feel overwhelming without proper guidance. 
Having successfully completed my undergraduate honors thesis defense with committee members [Dr. John Shea](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/people/faculty/john-m-shea/), [Dr. Tan Wong](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/people/faculty/tan-wong/), 
and [Dr. Christopher Petersen](https://mae.ufl.edu/people/name/christopher-petersen/), 
I want to share the complete process to help fellow students navigate this rewarding but challenging journey. <br>

The first step in pursuing an honors thesis is finding a research advisor within your department. This process should begin much earlier than most students realize - ideally during your junior year or earlier. 
You'll need to register for **EGN4912 (Undergraduate Research Credits)** and work with your advisor for at least one or two semesters before proposing your thesis. 
During this time, you should research faculty interests, attend office hours to discuss potential projects and look for professors whose work aligns with your academic interests. 
The key is developing a substantial project that can support a complete thesis while also ensuring your chosen advisor has the time and willingness to dedicate to your project. <br>

Once you've established a working relationship with your advisor and have a solid research foundation, the next crucial step is forming your thesis committee. 
This aspect of the process requires more strategic planning than most students anticipate. 
Your committee must consist of three members: your research advisor, who serves as the chair; a second faculty member from your department; and a third member from outside your department. 
The challenge lies in finding professors who are available and willing to serve, especially during busy academic semesters.
I learned the hard way that starting the committee formation process early is absolutely essential. Professors have packed schedules, 
and finding a defense date that works for all three committee members can be surprisingly difficult. 
For the ECE faculty member, consider professors you've had positive experiences with in coursework or those familiar with your research area. 
The external faculty member can be trickier to identify, especially if you don't have connections outside your department. 
I recommend leveraging your advisor's network, as they often have interdisciplinary connections. If not, you can look for faculty in related departments, 
such as Mathematics, Physics, or Computer Science. The most important advice I can offer is to secure a committee agreement and schedule your defense date as soon as possible, 
ideally 4-6 months before graduation, to avoid last-minute complications. <br> 

Writing the thesis itself presents its own unique challenges and rewards. It's essential to set realistic expectations for undergraduate research. 
The goal is to demonstrate your ability to conduct research and communicate technical concepts effectively rather than necessarily making groundbreaking discoveries. 
The scope and novelty of your work will largely depend on your field. In emerging areas, you might be able to contribute something genuinely novel during your undergraduate years. 
However, in more mature fields like mine, it can be more challenging to write something theoretically groundbreaking. 
Regardless of your field, undergraduate theses are generally viewed as a process of summarizing and analyzing your research work in a comprehensive, scholarly manner.
The writing process requires patience and regular communication with your advisor. Start writing early, 
even before your research is completely finished, and maintain regular meetings with your advisor for feedback and guidance. 
Your thesis should follow a traditional academic structure with an abstract, introduction, literature review, methodology, results, conclusion, 
and comprehensive references. Remember that this document represents months or years of your work, so take the time to make it thorough and well-written. <br> 

Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of the entire process is navigating the paperwork and administrative requirements. This is where many students encounter unexpected delays and stress. 
My strongest recommendation is to contact Ms. Nicole Young or the current honors coordinator immediately to obtain detailed information about the required forms and deadlines. 
One crucial tip that saved me significant headaches was to request **DocuSign** versions of all forms rather than traditional PDFs. 
Collecting physical signatures from busy professors can be incredibly time-consuming and stressful, especially as graduation deadlines approach. <br>

The defense presentation itself, while nerve-wracking, is typically the most rewarding part of the entire process. You'll present your work for 20-30 minutes, followed by a question and answer session with your committee members. 
The committee will then have a private discussion while you step out. Afterward, they'll notify you of the results, and 99% of the time, they will, of course, approve your work. 
The key to success is thorough preparation. Practice your presentation multiple times, prepare for questions about your methodology and results, and remember that you are now the expert on your specific research topic. <br>

Reflecting on my experience, the honors thesis process was challenging but incredibly valuable for my academic and professional development. 
The skills I developed - research methodology, technical writing, project management, and oral presentation - have served me well in graduate school and continue to benefit my academic career. 
The process also provided concrete examples of my capabilities that strengthened my graduate school applications and gave me confidence in interviews.
For students considering this path, I recommend viewing the honors thesis as a learning opportunity rather than just another graduation requirement. <br>

Start early, communicate proactively with all stakeholders, set realistic goals based on your field and timeline, and don't hesitate to leverage institutional resources like writing centers and library support. 
While the process requires significant time and effort, graduating with the highest honors is an achievement that will benefit you throughout your academic and professional career. 
The distinction demonstrates your commitment to excellence and your ability to complete substantial independent projects. This is a quality that graduate schools value highly.
