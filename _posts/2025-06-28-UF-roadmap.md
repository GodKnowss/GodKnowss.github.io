To be complete! <br>

Looking back on my time in UF's ECE program, I wish someone had told me earlier about the incredible career opportunities that open up when you dive deep into the mathematical side of electrical engineering. Signal processing, communications, and control systems represent some of the most intellectually rewarding paths you can take, and they lead to careers that most students don't even know exist.

## Why These Tracks Matter

Let me be honest - these aren't easy paths. You'll need strong mathematical skills, and the coursework can be demanding. However, what I've discovered is that this mathematical foundation gives you remarkable flexibility in an increasingly complex job market.
While traditional engineering roles remain plentiful and well-compensated, a strong mathematical background opens doors to diverse fields that many engineers can't access: quantitative finance, machine learning research, cryptography, data science, and emerging tech roles that didn't exist a decade ago. Defense contractors and research labs actively seek people who can bridge theoretical mathematics with practical applications.

## Signal Processing: Your Gateway to Advanced Mathematics
Everything begins with **EEL 3135 - Introduction to Signals and Systems**, which I consider the most important course in the entire ECE curriculum. I strongly recommend taking it in the spring semester with Dr. Harley, whose teaching quality is exceptional and whose course materials are among the best in our department. Dr. Wong also teaches an excellent version during the summer. While the course can seem confusing initially, it's actually quite manageable if you stay current with the material and attend lectures regularly. 
For students interested in the signal processing track, your next course should be **EEL 4750/5502 - Foundations of Digital Signal Processing**. This class builds directly on Signals and Systems, teaching you how to apply frequency domain concepts to discrete-time systems. The coursework involves significant MATLAB programming and practical implementation of filtering algorithms, making it both theoretically rich and practically applicable.

## Communications Systems: Theory Meets Practice
The communications track intersects beautifully with signal processing through **EEL 4514C - Communication Systems**. Although Dr. Shea no longer teaches this course, it remains one of the most valuable classes in the department. The course covers modulation schemes, channel coding, and information theory applications that are directly relevant to modern wireless systems and data transmission. Understanding these concepts opens doors to careers in telecommunications, satellite communications, and emerging 5G/6G technologies.
After completing communication systems, I highly recommend **EEE 5544 - Stochastic Processes 1**. This course is essentially advanced probability and random variables for engineers, providing the mathematical foundation for understanding noise, channel capacity, and statistical signal processing. Despite its intimidating name, the course is more interesting and manageable than many students expect, especially if you have a solid background from your probability and statistics courses.
