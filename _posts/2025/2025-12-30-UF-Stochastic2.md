To anyone that is interested in taking Stochastic 2 with Dr. Sean Meyn. He wants to tell you all that this class may not be offered again in the future. <br>
He is a great professor. So, take it at Spring 26 if you can. <br> 
Also, he will do his best to get back to you if you have reached out to him through email.
