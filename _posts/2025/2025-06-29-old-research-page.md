To be complete! <br>

I migrated this page from my old websites. I will slowly update and fix it. 

# Projects
Below are some of the research/personal projects I have worked on, focusing on FPGA design, signal processing, communication systems, machine learning, and embedded systems. 

## Ongoing Projects

### **Real-Time RF Spectrum Monitoring for Drone Detection**
- **Description**: This project involves implementing algorithms to detect the presence of signals characteristic of communications used to control unmanned aerial vehicles or drones.
- **Supervisor**: [Dr. John Shea](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/people/faculty/john-m-shea/) and [Dr. Tan Wong](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/people/faculty/tan-wong/) at Wireless Information Networking Group (WING) at the University of Florida


## Completed Projects

### **ARLO automonous drone**
- **Description**: This project involves implementing and testing FPGA on ARLO.
- **Supervisor**: [Dr. Christophe Bobda](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/people/faculty/christophe-bobda/) at Smart Systems Lab (SSL) at the University of Florida

### **Multi-view 2d boundary extraction**
- **Description**: This project involves developing and implementing a 3D object-tracking camera system using Python and OpenCV within the lab's testing space. I have also enhanced FFmpeg-based video streaming performance by 30% through CUDA hardware acceleration. 
- **Supervisor**: [Dr. Christophe Bobda](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/people/faculty/christophe-bobda/) at Smart Systems Lab (SSL) at the University of Florida

### **FPGA-based Pong Game**
- **Description**: This project involved designing and implementing a Pong game and VGA output using VHDL and implement it on FPGA.

### **American Sign Language Classifier**
- **Description**: In this project, my teammate and I have developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures.

### **Circuit Analysis Tool**
- **Description**: Developed a C++ tool for circuit analysis, calculating currents, voltage potentials, and drops from netlist data.
- **Outcome**: Improved efficiency by 20% using dynamic programming, optimizing performance for complex circuits.

### **Technology Mapping**
- **Description**: Designed and implemented a C++ program to transform logical expressions into optimized  NAND-NOT trees, calculating the minimal cost of the resulting structures.
- **Outcome**: Enhanced efficiency by 15% through dynamic programming

### **Open Project Space (OPS)**
- **Description**: Designed and implemented multiple projects related to circuits, signals, communication systems, and programming, like a small project on Red-Light Green Light. Led a team of 3 to complete multiple projects like Distant sensor and Red-Light Green Light.

## Publications
- **Undergraduate Honor Thesis (RF-Based Drone Detection Using RFSoC and SDR: Analysis and Automation Foundations)**

## Future Directions
I plan to continue advancing my research and studies in information theory, communication systems, machine learning, digital design, and more.
