I successfully defended my undergraduate honors thesis today before a committee consisting of [Dr. John Shea](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/people/faculty/john-m-shea/), [Dr. Tan Wong](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/people/faculty/tan-wong/), 
and [Dr. Christopher Petersen](https://mae.ufl.edu/people/name/christopher-petersen/), with two PhD students, William Davis and Tom Lattus from WING lab, also in attendance. <br>

I think Chris Malachowsky is also there who watched my defense briefly. 

Here is the link to my [paper](/publication/2025-04-16-honors-thesis).
