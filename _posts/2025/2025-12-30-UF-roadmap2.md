To be complete! <br>

This post is a reflection of my journey. The audience includes past me, and for anyone who is interested in the math side in ECE. <br>

### On choosing the "math-heavy" side of ECE

I went with signal processing, communication, and control theory. Not because of jobs or what is hot right now, but because I like the fundamentals. The stuff that feels more important, more foundational. <br>

At UF, the control sequence is basically dead, so skip that. For communication, the path is undergrad communication → random processes → digital communication or advanced courses. You can also do estimation and information theory. <br>

I really liked undergrad comm with Dr. John Shea but I don’t think he will teach this class in the near future. 

As an undergrad, you probably won't finish this whole sequence. If you want more, that's what grad school is for.

If you are deciding between this and embedded/hardware or semiconductor, trust what actually interests you. Don't just optimize for industry or employment. Pick what feels important to you.
