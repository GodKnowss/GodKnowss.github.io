I recently completed [a survey](/files/UF_materials/Courses/Graph_Theory/Graph_theory_Final_project_IEEE.pdf) on the **Age of Information (AoI)** for my Graph Theory class final project. 
This builds on my earlier presentation from April 16th, where I introduced the topic to my classmates and the instructor, Dr. John Shea.

The intersection of graph theory and information freshness opens up interesting optimization problems that go beyond traditional network performance measures. Looking forward to diving deeper into this area!
