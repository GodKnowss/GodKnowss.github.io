I recently completed [a simulation report](/files/UF_materials/Courses/Graph_Theory/Graph_theory_Final_project_IEEE.pdf) on the **Age of Information (AoI)** for my intro computer networks class final project 
with the other 2 teammates which are [Justin Nagovskiy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-nagovskiy/) and [Taewoo Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tae-kim-07a376224/).
