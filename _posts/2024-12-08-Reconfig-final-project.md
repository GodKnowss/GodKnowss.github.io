Here is our [FPGA convolution accelerator project report](/files/UF_materials/Courses/EEL5721_ReconfigurableComputing/final_project_report.pdf), completed with my friend, [Zack Mendez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-m-mendez/),
for Dr. Greg Stitt's [Reconfigurable Computing 1 course](http://www.gstitt.ece.ufl.edu/courses/fall24/eel4720_5721/labs/convolve/convolve.pdf). <br>
We successfully implemented a custom hardware solution that significantly outperforms traditional software convolution through parallel processing and optimized datapath design.
