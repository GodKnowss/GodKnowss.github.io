To be complete! <br>

Welcome to my corner of the internet! If you're wondering what "MTsEntropy" means, let me explain the story behind this admittedly nerdy website name.

## Decoding the Name
In information theory, **entropy** measures the information content of a signal - how much useful, valuable information something contains. MTsEntropy applies this principle to academic knowledge sharing: 
**maximizing useful information for electrical engineering students while minimizing the noise of confusion and uncertainty.**

This site serves as a high-capacity channel for transmitting insights about signal processing, communications theory, graduate school navigation, and research methodologies to students ready to decode the mathematical beauty of modern electrical engineering.

## My Dual Mission
This website serves two interconnected purposes:

**Personal Portfolio** ðŸŽ¯ - Showcasing my academic achievements, research projects, and professional journey as a Graduate Research Fellow pursuing my PhD at Purdue (proud Gator alum with highest honors).

**Educational Resource** ðŸ“š - Helping fellow students navigate electrical engineering through tutorials, course reviews, and practical guidance I wish I'd had during my own journey.
